R package/scripts for the Methylation Age Determination via Read-Informed Data (MADRID) epigenetic clock

Hey, thanks for stopping on by!

Do you have your own sequence-based methylation data that you want to build your own clock with? If so, feel free to email me at at madrid2@wisc.edu and we can work it out together. I am always happy to collaborate!
